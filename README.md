# Introduction
If you've gotten to this page, you're either here because I applied to work for you, or you stumbled upon it (you won't regret it!). Regardless, welcome. Here I will unfold, like a story/autobiography work of art, information about the languages I've learned, some of the projects I've made (most are university assignments, available in my repository), and perhaps most importantly, what I'm working on next! This will be regularly updated, and I'll reduce the technical jargon to make for easy (easier) reading. 

# Codecademy®
I've been using this website for years. Yes, I've tried other sites, like Khan Academy®, Udemy® etc., but several things draw me back to Codecademy®, over and over again.
1. Getting to DO things, rather than watch a video of someone talking through it
   - Programmers often start itching to code ASAP.
   - Give them a big block of text to read, or a 15-minute video to watch, they might run screaming.
   - The courses on Codecademy® (founded in 2011, CEO Zach Sims) usually have a healthy balance
   - It's important to know the theory yes, and get right into all the tiny nooks, crannies and quirks of language to really understand AND remember it. 
   - I don't do well with videos. I can watch them, yes, and make notes and all that. But I'd prefer to extract important information quickly and efficiently, and from experience that's *much* harder to do when someone's droning on and, sometimes, having to reexplain 'tricky' concepts to cater for anyone that might be slipping up from time to time.
   - Codecademy® is like doing your own research and lab experiments, instead of having to sit in a class of 40+ people like in school (granted, the people learning a language want to be there, and not to metaphorically hurtle annoying balls of paper at people's heads). Much more exciting, and personally, easier to stay motivated with. Gotta keep that crunch going!
