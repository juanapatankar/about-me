# Introduction
If you've gotten to this page, you're either here because I applied to work for you, or you stumbled upon it (you won't regret it!). Regardless, welcome. Here I will unfold, like a story/autobiography work of art, information about the languages I've learned, some of the projects I've made (most are university assignments, available in my repository), and perhaps most importantly, what I'm working on next! This will be regularly updated, and I'll reduce the technical jargon to make for easy (easier) reading. 

# Codecademy® Introduction
I've been using this website for years. Yes, I've tried other sites, like Khan Academy®, Udemy® etc., but several things draw me back to Codecademy®, over and over again.
Disclaimer: I've not been sponsored by Codecademy®

1. Getting to DO things, rather than watch a video of someone talking through it
   - Programmers often start itching to code ASAP.
   - Give them a big block of text to read, or a 15-minute video to watch, they might run screaming.
   - The courses on Codecademy® (founded in 2011, CEO Zach Sims) usually have a healthy balance
   - It's important to know the theory yes, and get right into all the tiny nooks, crannies and quirks of language to really understand AND remember it. 
   - I don't do well with videos. I can watch them, yes, and make notes and all that. But I'd prefer to extract important information quickly and efficiently, and from experience that's *much* harder to do when someone's droning on and, sometimes, having to reexplain 'tricky' concepts to cater for anyone that might be slipping up from time to time.
   - Codecademy® is like doing your own research and lab experiments, instead of having to sit in a class of 40+ people like in school (granted, the people learning a language want to be there, and not to metaphorically hurtle annoying balls of paper at people's heads). Much more exciting, and personally, easier to stay motivated with. Gotta keep that crunch going!

2. Delivered in small chunks
   - I touched on this earlier (re: big blocks, long videos), but it's so easy to get started and just jump in
   - The lessons go at a good pace, and you're free to just binge your way through them if you so wish
   - Watching a progress bar go higher and higher gives an incredible serotonin boost
   
3. Easy to get help
   - Invariably, even the best of us stumble on odd little bits. Dodgy logic, or careless syntax (hint: I make my code very readable. I also pretend this isn't because I don't get back to my code when I'm half asleep at 4am sometimes).
   - Sometimes you don't want to trawl through page after page of long jargon-y forum posts for a small thing. That's what Stack Overflow is for.
   - 'View Solution' is a lifesaver. Of course it's not perfect, but it really does work pretty well. And it's optional to replace your code with it, or keep it so you can work towards compiling code step-by-step and see exactly WHERE you went wrong.
   - Yeah, you learn from mistakes. But you're less inclined to remember the moral if you've spent the past 4 hours pulling at your hair in dismay. More like you'll want to put your laptop away and not look at it for the rest of the day. Unhelpful. Now you get to feel good and it feels less like giving up :)

# How I've used Codeacademy (and others)
With the above revealed (wow, an essay), here is a list of the languages I've learned (and refreshed) over the past few years. The below list is with the most recent at the top.
