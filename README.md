# Introduction
If you've gotten to this page, you're either here because I applied to work for you, or you stumbled upon it (you won't regret it!). Regardless, welcome. Here I will unfold, like a story/autobiography work of art, information about the languages I've learned, some of the projects I've made (most are university assignments, available in my repository), and perhaps most importantly, what I'm working on next! This will be regularly updated, and I'll reduce the technical jargon to make for easy (easier) reading. 

# A bit more about me
I have lived in England all my life, and I come from a family of methodical, progressive people. My dad is a born software developer, and he has such a profound love for his job that it really is quite a sight. It's very refreshing to see that even though he's been programming for his whole career, he still has all the wonder of someone just starting out in the industry (with the bonus of being super mature about deadlines, balancing his priorities, and all that jazz). Watching him constantly learn new technologies alongside his day job has really given me an insight into how fast-paced the software developing career can be, and how no day is ever the same or totally predictable. My mum loves her numbers, and she has an uncanny gift for coming across a payment amount once, then remembering it again sometimes days later when she is trying to balance the books. Not to boast, but people ask for her specifically when they need help and even though she was new(ish) to the team she's currently in, she was still in charge of training new projects recruits. It's like numbers are her second language. After seeing how passionate they both are about their jobs, is it really any wonder that I'm much the same with my own career development?

# Codecademy® Introduction
I've been using this website for years. Yes, I've tried other sites, like Khan Academy®, Udemy® etc., but several things draw me back to Codecademy®, over and over again.
Disclaimer: I've not been sponsored by Codecademy®

1. Getting to DO things, rather than watch a video of someone talking through it
   - Programmers often start itching to code ASAP.
   - Give them a big block of text to read, or a 15-minute video to watch, they might run screaming.
   - The courses on Codecademy® (founded in 2011, CEO Zach Sims) usually have a healthy balance
   - It's important to know the theory yes, and get right into all the tiny nooks, crannies and quirks of language to really understand AND remember it. 
   - I don't do well with videos. I can watch them, yes, and make notes and all that. But I'd prefer to extract important information quickly and efficiently, and from experience that's *much* harder to do when someone's droning on and, sometimes, having to reexplain 'tricky' concepts to cater for anyone that might be slipping up from time to time.
   - Codecademy® is like doing your own research and lab experiments, instead of having to sit in a class of 40+ people like in school (granted, the people learning a language want to be there, and not to metaphorically hurtle annoying balls of paper at people's heads). Much more exciting, and personally, easier to stay motivated with. Gotta keep that crunch going!

2. Delivered in small chunks
   - I touched on this earlier (re: big blocks, long videos), but it's so easy to get started and just jump in
   - The lessons go at a good pace, and you're free to just binge your way through them if you so wish
   - Watching a progress bar go higher and higher gives an incredible serotonin boost
   
3. Easy to get help
   - Invariably, even the best of us stumble on odd little bits. Dodgy logic, or careless syntax (hint: I make my code very readable. I also pretend this isn't because I don't get back to my code when I'm half asleep at 4am sometimes).
   - Sometimes you don't want to trawl through page after page of long jargon-y forum posts for a small thing. That's what Stack Overflow is for.
   - 'View Solution' is a lifesaver. Of course it's not perfect, but it really does work pretty well. And it's optional to replace your code with it, or keep it so you can work towards compiling code step-by-step and see exactly WHERE you went wrong.
   - Yeah, you learn from mistakes. But you're less inclined to remember the moral if you've spent the past 4 hours pulling at your hair in dismay. More like you'll want to put your laptop away and not look at it for the rest of the day. Unhelpful. Now you get to feel good and it feels less like giving up :)

# How I've used Codeacademy (and others)
With the above revealed (wow, an essay), here is a list of the languages I've learned (and refreshed) over the past few years.
1) Java
2) JavaScript (also React.js)
3) Python
4) C#
5) HTML/CSS
6) Swift


From other sites/resources
7) Haskell (from university)
8) Java for Android (dabbled)
9) Some C (uni)
10) 7) Haskell (from university)
11) Visual Basic
12) AWS (specifically EC2, although very new to it)

# Where I plan to go from here
I would just LOVE to get some real-world experience. I've spent more time recently on YouTube, raptly listening to and absorbing the wisdom of those in the IT industry already (shoutout to TiffInTech and Forrest Knight, a couple of my favourites!). I truly believe that, especially in an industry as broad and challenging in IT, it's imperative to have several people to admire and take a leaf out of their book (a line out of their code?), as it were. There's something to be learnt from anyone, anywhere. I've looked into other career fields outside of IT but for me IT just really had that special place in my career planning, and I just really want to get my hands dirty.

Technology-wise, there is always some new up-and-coming language or, well, technology to be learned, that employers often request from candidates looking for their next (or first!) world to dive into. The ones I believe I will like, and currently see the most promise in, personally) are:
1) Ruby
2) Scala
3) PHP
4) Node.js (I will be working on this after React)
5) AWS
6) Microsoft Azure
7) Kotlin

This is, honestly, quite a list. I won't lie, there are days this mountain just seems insurmountable, and I struggle to even think about how to get started on breaking this down into more manageable chunks. But by writing it down, I'm hoping that not only will you get a bit of an insider overview as to what I am like as a developer, and who I aspire to be, but I'll manage to make a bit more sense of it in my head. Perspective is a huge thing, and it's usually one of the main things that help with - well, OTHER huge things. I'm still learning what kind of developer I'd like to be, and while this (and my drive, enthusiasm, and straight up courage) means I'll pretty much jump at the chance to get my hands dirty in whatever glorious way I can, I am slowly starting to whittle it down by figuring out what makes my heart sing (ugh, corny) and what I, candidly, don't prefer as much. Like how I prefer chocolate to peanuts as a snack, but that doesn't mean I won't eat peanuts while I'm rewatching Marvel's Infinity War for the 4th time.

There's a lot of information here, I know. I got very carried away talking about myself, which is ironic because I didn't think I was that good at telling my own story. To real life people. Other stories, eh, sure. But this has helped A LOT with imposter syndrome, and I hope it cheers me up the next time I get a little overwhelmed and need a reminder of the direction I'm going (up and up!)
